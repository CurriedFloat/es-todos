
You do not have an eventsourced architecture!
Event sourcing and cqrs are per service/bounded context decisions.

Example DDD style system:
Auth    -> third party -> so who cares
Core    -> CQRS+ES
Support -> CRUD

Consider Event Sourcing + CQRS when doing:
- rich domain models
- version control for data
- audit
- business value or competitive advantage derived from event data
- inherently event driven domains
