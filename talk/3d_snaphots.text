
If deriving state on demand becomes to slow -> use the snapshot pattern.

A snapshot is just a memoization of the fold up to a certain event.

To derive state we find the latest snapshot and use it as the strating point 
and apply all events that happend after.

state = foldL(applyEvent, latestSnapshot, eventsAfterSnapshot)
