
Pros of Event sourcing
- Functional approach to state
- Explicit state transitions
- Easier for a domain expert to understand the event log than our RDB.
- Temporal quering capabilities (time travel).
- First level audit  
  The data itself is a verifiable audit log.
  Does not lose intent.
- The storage system becomes an additive only architecture.
  Append-only architectures distribute.
  Far fewer locks to deal with.
